# Barthap's dotfiles

Nothing to do here. Nothing to see here. Wanna know why? I'll never understand people using artifacts of the past like command line, terminals, bash, vim and all that stuff. It's 2023 - GUI exists for decades now and there's no need to manually type stuff and remember all that commands. Now, besides keyboard, you have another powerful tool available - a MOUSE!

You wanna know how to exit vim? Just click the red button in the corner of the terminal window. It closes vim along with the whole terminal. You don't need it.

So why this repo exists? Because every linux pro user has such repo and I wanna be considered pro too

_Just kidding, nothing here yet because I'm too lazy to configure everything nicely_
